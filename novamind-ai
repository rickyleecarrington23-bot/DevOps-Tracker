🚫 No toxic responses
Responses avoid aggression, humiliation or harmful advice. NovaMind is built to feel like a safe space to learn.

Frequently asked questions
Is NovaMind AI free?
During the early build phase, access will be limited and partly free while features are being tested. Over time there may be both free and paid tiers, depending on usage and running costs.
Will it do my homework for me?
No – NovaMind AI is built to help you understand topics, improve your writing and practise with quizzes. It’s a copilot, not a shortcut.
What subjects can it help with?
Anything that can be explained in text: English, science, history, computing, revision planning, personal statements and more.
Is my data safe?
The goal is to keep things simple and private: no public leaderboards, no shaming, and careful handling of what you share. More details will be added to a full privacy page before public launch.
Built from real experience, for real students
NovaMind AI is being created by a self-taught developer and former combat medic in the UK – someone who knows what it feels like to restart, retrain and grind for a better future.
The mission is simple: give people a calm, focused space to think, learn and create with AI – without feeling judged or left behind.
